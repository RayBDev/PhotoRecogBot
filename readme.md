  Photo RecogBot Frontend
</h1>

This is the Frontend of the [Photo RecogBot Application](https://github.com/RayBDev/PhotoRecogBot).

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **NodeJS + PostgreSQL**

    NodeJS was used for the signin, register and user info endpoints. PostgreSQL allowed for better database segmentation due to its relational nature.

2.  **Heroku**

    The application is hosted on Heroku due to its backend requirements.
